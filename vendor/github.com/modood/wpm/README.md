Wildcard Pattern Matching

Given a text and a wildcard pattern finds if it is matched with text.
The matching should cover the entire text (not partial text).

The wildcard pattern can include the characters `?` and `*`

*   `?` – matches any single character

*   `*` – Matches any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence)
